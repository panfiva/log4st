# Log4ts TypeScript Project

This project is inspired by [log4js-node](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node)

Key differences:

- Migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript
- Migrated functions and global variables to classes
- Do not use configuration to configure the project - instantiate class instances instead
- Allows multiple loggers in a project
